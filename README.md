Brainprint Authentication Using Long Short Term Memory Model
=======
# Brainprint Authentication System 🧠🔐

A Python-based GUI demonstration for a biometric authentication system using EEG signals and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modeling.

## 📝 Overview
This project demonstrates the pipeline of a Brainprint authentication system. It visualizes the process of capturing raw EEG signals, preprocessing them, and feeding them into a simulated LSTM neural network to verify a user's identity.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Signal Visualization:** Simulates 4-channel EEG data streams.
- **Processing Pipeline:** Visualizes the steps of Signal Cleaning, Normalization, and Feature Extraction.
- **Authentication Output:** Displays the identified user and confidence score based on the simulated model.
- **Dark Mode UI:** Professional, high-fidelity interface designed with `tkinter`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **GUI Framework:** Tkinter
- **Data Simulation:** NumPy
- **Plotting:** Matplotlib
